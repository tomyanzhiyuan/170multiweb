                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

                    <p>Helldivers 2 is a shooter game primarily played from a third-person perspective. Players complete
                        tasks
                        <em>(called "Missions") in procedurally generated levels (or "Operations")</em> while fending
                        off
                        hordes of
                        enemies. Players choose the difficulty level of their Operations, ranging from level 1
                        ("Trivial")
                        to level
                        10 ("Super Helldive").
                    </p>

                    <h3>Difficulty Level of Operations from Easy to Hardest</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Trivial</li>
                        <li>Easy</li>
                        <li>Medium</li>
                        <li>Challenging</li>
                        <li>Hard</li>
                        <li>Extreme</li>
                        <li>Suicide Mission</li>
                        <li>Impossible</li>
                        <li>Helldive</li>
                        <li>Super Helldive</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>A core gameplay feature carried over from the first game is the use of
                        <strong>"Stratagems",</strong>
                        powerful equipment which must be called in from orbit by executing a sequence of directional
                        button
                        or arrow
                        key inputs. Players may select up to four Stratagems in advance to take into the mission with
                        them,
                        as well
                        as a "Booster" which affects the whole team. Helldivers 2 features cooperative multiplayer with
                        up
                        to four
                        players,<em> but does not include a dedicated single-player campaign</em>. It also provides
                        optional
                        cross-play between PlayStation 5 and Windows. Friendly fire is always on. In the initial days of
                        release,
                        gameplay involved staff at the studio observing players and influencing gameplay in real time.

                        completing
                        operations, missions, and objectives.
                    </p>

                    <p>As players gain experience and progress in levels, they unlock different <em>weapons and
                            Stratagems</em> to
                        use during missions. Players can also collect <strong>"Samples"</strong>, which are used to
                        upgrade
                        the
                        player's Super Destroyer starship, providing advantages during gameplay. By completing

                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>

                    <h3>Setting</h3>
                    <p>Helldivers 2 takes place in the <strong>22nd century</strong>, one hundred years after the
                        triumph of
                        Super
                        Earth, a self-described managed democracy, over the Bugs, Cyborgs, and Illuminate during the
                        First
                        Galactic
                        War. Humanity seized <em>faster-than-light (FTL) travel technology</em> from the defeated
                        Illuminate, and
                        used it to conquer the galaxy during a period known as the <strong>Great
                            Democratization</strong>.
                        Humanity
                        also discovered that the decomposing corpses of the Bugs contain a unique and highly valuable
                        resource known
                        as <strong>E-710</strong> which is used for FTL travel. Bug farms are established on
                        human-colonized
                        worlds,
                        and after decades of genetic engineering and accelerated evolution, they become known as the
                        <strong>Terminids</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Plot</h3>
                    <p>The events of Helldivers 2 begins after the Super Earth Armed Forces fail to contain the
                        Terminids,
                        <em>which have escaped their farms and are causing widespread chaos and destruction</em>.
                        Simultaneously, a
                        new threat emerges in the form of the <strong>Automatons</strong>, descendants of the defeated
                        Cyborgs,
                        intent on getting revenge against humanity. Subsequently, the <strong>Illuminate</strong>, an
                        ancient and
                        technologically advanced alien race thought to be extinct, return and invade Super Earth's
                        colonies.
                        In
                        response, Super Earth declares war and mobilizes the Helldivers, an elite task force, to combat
                        the
                        threats.

                    <h2>Development and Release</h2>
                    <p>On <strong>3 December 2020, Arrowhead Game Studios</strong> revealed that work had started on a
                        new
                        project
                        for PlayStation 5. It was confirmed that the game would be a third-person shooter. Like the
                        first
                        game,
                        Helldivers 2 runs on the discontinued Autodesk Stingray game engine (originally known as
                        Bitsquid).
                        Arrowhead Game Studios founder <strong>Johan Pilestedt</strong> confirmed on social media that
                        "The
                        project
                        started before [Stingray] was discontinued," adding, "Our crazy engineers had to do everything,
                        with
                        no

                        Arrowhead's
                        social media manager starting their workday, which is followed by a series of posts from fans
                        demanding them
                        to release the game. On <strong>18 August 2022</strong>, a 12-second clip of gameplay was leaked
                        on
                        Twitter,
                        but was later removed. On <strong>24 May 2023</strong>, Helldivers 2 was announced during the
                        <em>2023

                        rating by
                        the Entertainment Software Rating Board for "blood and gore" and "intense violence". <strong>On

                    <p>Built with support for the most popular PC, console, and mobile platforms in mind, Bitsquid was
                        utilized in
                        the creation of various games, including Escape Dead Island, Hamilton's Great Adventure,

                        Following its
                        acquisition by Maya and 3ds Max developer Autodesk in 2014, the engine was integrated into the
                        company's

                    <h2>Reception</h2>
                    <p>Helldivers 2 received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator
                        website
                        <strong>Metacritic</strong>. Upon release, the game experienced a large influx of players,
                        <em>leading to
                            widespread server and login issues for the first two weeks of release</em>. By the third
                        week of
                        release,
                        the player cap was increased to <strong>"a whopping 700,000 concurrent users"</strong> according
                        to
                        Wesley
                        Yin-Poole of IGN.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Aaron Bayne</strong> of Push Square described the game as "a riotous affair, offering up
                        best-in-class gunplay" and a "truly epic and often cinematic experience, mixed in with one of
                        the
                        best co-op
                        gameplay romps currently available. However, he criticized the game for the server issues and
                        crashes that
                        players experienced after release. Helldivers 2 has been compared to the <em>1997 science
                            fiction
                            action
                            film Starship Troopers</em>; both are satirical comedies featuring a militaristic regime
                        fighting against
